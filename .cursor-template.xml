<INSTRUCTIONS> 
Create a series of very detailed, comprehensive instructions to build out all of the components of this application and use storybook stories to create 
a very very detailed view of each page and each component for this new application. Use the basic techniques and workflows and goals of the original 
software, but create a modern UI. Remember you are not writing the code, just providing a set of detailed instructions for an 
AI coding agent to build and write stories for all of the frontend components.
